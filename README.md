# Big Bang Brokers
 
Welcome to the project repository for Team 4, the Big Bang Brokers. We are creating an intergalactic marketplace. 
This is an e-commerce experience designed for users to browse and buy planets from across the universe. 
We will be using Python, Flask, and SQLite as the foundation for our website. 
Here, we will document our presentations, artifacts, and source code for our project.

## Requirements
After working closely with our client, we identified the key requirements and functionalities necessary for the success of our system. Our work aims to create an online marketplace where users can discover and purchase unique planets. The platform will allow users to register and log in to their accounts, browse inventory, and complete a secure checkout process that includes payment and shipping verification. Administrative users will have exclusive privileges allowing management of inventory, promoting accounts, and overseeing sales activities.

The detailed requirement document can be found [here](requirements/README.md)
